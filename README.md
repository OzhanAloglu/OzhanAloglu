###  HiðŸ‘‹ My name is Ozhan Aloglu

## I'm a Software Developer

- ðŸ’¬ I graduated from Gebze Technical University Department of Surveying Engineering in 2022. After the software courses I saw at school, my interest in software started and I received a professional training when I finished school. This training was ISKUR supported Web and Mobile Programming (800 hours) training. As a result of the training, software developer certificates were given by Microsoft, MEB and Ä°SKUR. I care a lot about learning new things and developing my skills, and I think it is necessary to benefit from the teaching power of human relations for this purpose. I think it is important to be creative in both business and personal life, being aware that developing ideas keeps the mind and therefore the body constantly active.
